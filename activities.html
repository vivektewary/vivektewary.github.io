<br>
<li>I presented a talk on "Regularity theory for parabolic fractional p-Laplace equations" on 16th August 2022 in a Mathematics colloquium at <a href="https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/" target="_blank">TIFR Centre for Applicable Mathematics, Bengaluru</a>.</li>
<br>
<li>I presented a talk on "Regularity theory for parabolic fractional p-Laplace equations" on 13th July 2022 in an online Mathematics colloquium at <a href="http://dmat.cfm.cl/dmat/" target="_blank">Departamento de Matemática, Facultad de Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas, University of Concepción, Chile</a>. The video recording of the colloquium may be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMLUukVIg3M" target="_blank">here</a> on YouTube.</li>
<br>
<li>I presented a talk on "Regularity theory for parabolic fractional p-Laplace equations" on 07th June 2022 at <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>.</li>
